# Charging Canon R-series cameras with USB-C

I've seen numerous admonishments in videos and web sites to use a PD charger and cable. No matter what I tried, I could not get the green charging lamp to light.

What no one mentions (except for one random comment on a blog post) There is a "Step 0". That step 0 is to be using an OEM Canon battery! It doesn't seem to work with third party batteries.
